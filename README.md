# Augmented-Reality-Project-with-Face-Detection-and-Recognition
Computer vision application for face detection and recognition that allows the inclusion of virtual elements aligned with real objects.


This project allows:

Based on set of identified faces (training set) and a set of unidentified faces (test set), belonging to the same people, identify each person in the test set. EigenFaces and FisherFaces methods were used to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset.

Perform the combination of virtual and real objects. In this 
the goal was to be able to add virtual objects to an individual's face in in real time, such as a hat.

Deep learning neural network models with pre-trained  convolutional  neural networks for face detection were used.
